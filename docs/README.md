### Usecase

Marro is born out of an idea that creative services should have a standadized pricing strategy.
Marro uses the old adage of do you want it good or fast or cheap. This philosophy allows creatives to quickly
come up with a standard price for their services.

### Initial Demography

Currently Marro serves videographers and spits out a daily rate that should allow them to cater to their services.
A long term approach would be to create pricing strategies for numerous creative fields.


### How to use

On the web UI, select 2 variables you want to consider when coming up with a price. We'll calibrate the price from the
backend using these variables and add a percentage margin of profit to the final price. The final price is the daily rate.
